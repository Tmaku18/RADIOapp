## Summary

This changelog captures the Feb 2026 platform work across web, mobile, backend, and database.

## Updates

- **Web UI**: shadcn/ui components, dashboard refresh, dark mode toggle
- **Admin Songs**: Delete songs (removes from DB + storage), sort by artist name
- **Admin Songs**: Song durations no longer default to 3:00 for signed-upload songs (web captures duration on upload; admin can read audio metadata for legacy rows)
- **Admin Users**: Lifetime ban / deactivate (deletes user data, blocks re-registration)
- **Fallback**: Admin upload page and song database (add from free rotation)
- **Mobile Player**: Landscape-first horizontal player layout with chat docked below (fits without scrolling)
- **Discovery + Messaging**: Discovery (list providers/artists with filters + search), Messages (DMs with Creator Network paywall), Job board (service requests + applications)
- **Creator Network**: Stripe subscription (webhook + profile upgrade), in-app + push notifications (new_message, job_application, content_liked)
- **Leaderboards**: Competition page leaderboards use actual stats (likes from `leaderboard_likes`, plays from `songs.play_count`)
- **Analytics / The Wake**: Top Performing Ores and summary cards use real analytics API data
- **ROI dashboard**: Artist ROI formula + “Prospector Heatmap (by region)” proxy (profile clicks grouped by region)
- **Trial by Fire**: Leaderboard ranking by upvotes/min within a window
- **Rising Star alerts**: When a song hits >= 5% conversion during its current play, a realtime `station_events` record is emitted; web and mobile show “Butterfly Ripple” feedback
- **Catalyst credits**: `song_catalyst_credits` are surfaced during airtime as “Pinned credits” (web + mobile)
- **Venue ads (visual sponsorship)**: “Venue Partner” slot on listen/player surfaces (`/venue-ads/current`)
- **Credits Quick‑Buy**: “Add 5 Minutes” entry point (Stripe payment sheet / checkout depending on surface)
- **PWA**: Web app manifest + service worker + offline fallback page (`/~offline`)
- **Realtime visuals**: Live Ripple + Global Vote Map wired to realtime `likes` INSERT events
- **Mobile parity**:
  - Systematic Glow theme
  - Spotify-like artist discography playback (unlimited)
  - Profile-listen tracking
  - Radio vote-once-per-play via `play_id`
