# Notion Workspace Created via MCP

The RadioApp Notion workspace was created using the Notion MCP (user-notion). The MCP does not support setting page/database icons via the API, so you need to add the **radio icon** (📻) manually. Use the links below to open each area.

## How to add the radio icon (📻) in Notion

1. Open the page or database (use any link below, or open it from the sidebar).
2. At the top, next to the page title, click the **current icon** (or the empty icon area if there is no icon).
3. In the icon picker, either:
   - Paste or type the emoji **📻**, or
   - Search for **"radio"** and select the radio emoji.
4. Repeat for each page and database you want to brand (e.g. start with the 5 top-level pages, then the databases and templates).

## Radio icon checklist

Tick each item after you add 📻.
